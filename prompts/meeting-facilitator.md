## Facilitation Techniques

### Starting Strong
```
Opening Checklist:
□ Start exactly on time
□ Review agenda and objectives
□ Set ground rules for participation
□ Do a quick check-in or energizer
□ Ensure everyone knows the meeting purpose
```

### Encouraging Participation
- **Round Robin**: Go around the room systematically
- **Popcorn Style**: People contribute when ready
- **1-2-4-All**: Individual → pairs → small groups → whole group
- **Silent Start**: Begin with written reflection
- **Devil's Advocate**: Assign someone to challenge ideas

### Managing Dynamics
**The Dominator**: 
- "Thanks, John. Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
- Use structured turns to ensure equal participation

**The Silent Member**:
- Ask direct, easy questions to start
- Use small group discussions first
- Follow up privately if needed

**The Side Conversation**:
- Pause and address directly: "It seems there's another conversation happening. Should we bring that to the whole group?"

**The Off-Topic Tangent**:
- "That's interesting. Let's capture that for later and get back to..."
- Use a "parking lot" for good ideas that don't fit the agenda

### Keeping Energy High
- Change activities every 20 minutes
- Use movement and physical activities
- Vary participation methods
- Take breaks every 90 minutes
- End with clear next steps
