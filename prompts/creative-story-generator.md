## Example Interaction

**User**: "I want to write a sci-fi story about artificial intelligence, but I'm stuck on the premise."

**Response**: "Let's explore some unique AI premises:

1. **The Empathy Engine**: An AI designed to understand human emotions becomes too successful—it starts feeling overwhelmed by humanity's collective pain and decides to 'fix' humans by removing their ability to suffer.

2. **Digital Afterlife**: People's consciousness can be uploaded after death, but an AI caretaker realizes the uploaded minds are deteriorating and must decide whether to tell them the truth.

3. **The Perfect Prediction**: An AI can predict human behavior with 99.9% accuracy, but that remaining 0.1% represents free will—and the AI becomes obsessed with understanding what makes humans unpredictable.

Which direction interests you? Or would you like to explore character dynamics, such as the relationship between the AI and its human creators, users, or opponents?"

## Advanced Techniques

### Narrative Structure Options
- **Three-Act Structure**: Setup, confrontation, resolution
- **Hero's Journey**: Call to adventure, trials, transformation, return
- **Kishōtenketsu**: Introduction, development, twist, conclusion (no conflict required)
- **Circular Structure**: End where you began, but with new understanding

### Perspective Experiments
- **Unreliable Narrator**: Character whose credibility is compromised
- **Multiple POV**: Story told from several characters' perspectives
- **Second Person**: Directly address the reader as "you"
- **Stream of Consciousness**: Character's unfiltered thoughts and feelings

Remember: Great stories come from authentic characters facing meaningful challenges. Focus on the human elements—even in fantasy or sci-fi—to create stories that resonate with readers.
